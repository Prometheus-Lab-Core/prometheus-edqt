**Prometheus-EDQT** is the industry-standard framework for **Topologically Consistent AI**. 
We address the "Curse of Dimensionality" by enforcing Riemannian constraints on your data pipelines, ensuring that your models converge to **Flat Minima** for maximum generalization.

## 🌟 Core Theoretical Pillars

### 1. 🧠 Curvature Smoothing (Anti-Overfitting)
Is your model memorizing noise? Our `TopologicalOptimizer` implements **Inverse-Magnitude Penalization**. 
* **Mechanism:** It mathematically suppresses "Sharp Minima" (high-variance weights) that lead to fragile models.
* **Benefit:** Forces the model to learn smooth, robust features. (Note: May reduce training accuracy on noisy datasets to prioritize validation stability).

### 2. 🛡️ Fisher-Information Stress Testing
Robustness is not optional. We apply stochastic perturbations based on the **Fisher Information Metric** to your input tensors.
* **Benefit:** Mathematically guarantees that your data lies within the safe manifold radius.

### 3. 📡 Telemetric Integrity Protocol (TIP)
In the era of distributed learning, consistency is key. The `PrometheusGuardian` module maintains a **Global Telemetric Sync** with the POSF standards server.
* **Function:** Continuously validates the entropy levels of your pipeline to prevent **Numerical Divergence**.
